I've always loved video games growing up, but I never had an exposure to the innerworkings of computers. I went to college for something unrelated and after working in that field for a couple years and being constantly bored, I began watching coding videos and looking up tutorials online. Miraculously, programming made sense to me; I was able to wrap my mind around the basics and write some simple programs. After six months of being seriously committed to self-study, I realized that a career shift was feasible and that I could do something I actually love. I've loved learning so far and can't wait to start tackling more advanced topics!
