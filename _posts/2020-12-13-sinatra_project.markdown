Hey, what's up you guys. I didn't do my project back in July, so I am repeating this module and the project is due tonight. This is my blog post.

What have I learned about myself while waiting to repeat this module so I can move on? I will self-sabotage like nobody's business. Blame depression; blame anxiety; blame laziness. I have a difficult time self motivating or improving myself. I'm not sure how to describe it. I am a hard worker when it effects other people or I know the end product matters, but if the only result is that I am increasing my potential, I just don't act. I am trying to change that though. I am working on my self-discipline and will make a real and conscious effort to actively engage during the next module - rails.

As always, once I did start working, I had a blast. Sinatra is so cool; I love that as I advance through this course all the things I've encountered in software/on the Internet start making sense. My brain can start to break down what goes into the Internet of things.
