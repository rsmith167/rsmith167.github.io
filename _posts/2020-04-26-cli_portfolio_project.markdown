What's up, guys? It's ya boi, Rwanda, back at it again with another blog post.

This post is about my time working on the first portfolio project. We are supposed to create a command line interface app that accesses the internet. To be honest, the actual coding was not that difficult. I am able to watch videos or go through the lessons, remember what was done, and just whip something out. I struggled tremedously getting Ubuntu and Visual Studio Code up and running. One of the reasons I finally signed up for Flatiron was because I can do things on my own, but once I hit a wall, I stop. I can learn the basics, but one I encounter a topic that I don't immediately understand, I just give up. I really appreciate that fact that Flatiron forces us to google some topics instead of spoon feeding us absolutely everything. I've come to realize it's an important skill; programming is such a large concept/subject and no institution can teach you everything. You have to learn how to learn on your own and how to use the internet to find cool and new ways to accomplish something.

Back to linux. I can not believe that macs are good for something. Honest. I have always used andriod/windows because I thought it was the best - I also game a lot and a lot of game work best on windows. I struggled to get linux/Ubuntu up and running as well as knowing exactly how to configure Visual Studio Code. Because I was afraid of setting up my own local environment ( and asking anybody else for help because I felt embarrassed that I had waited so long), I put off working on this project until last Saturday, 4/18/20. Eventually, I sat down, read through the instructions Micah put together, and after a few hours had it done. Like I said up above, I can replicate something that has been shown to me - like in the labs, we get instructions, then examples, then a test that tells us if we've done it right. I got super comfortable just breezing by. This project pushed me, not just in setting up a local environment, but also in creating something. In class, we've been using the tests to know exactly what needs to be programmed. This was harder. I had to figure out what I want to do, do it, check it myself, then correct it. It was really fun though. I can't wait to start the next topic and then the next project. It feels really good to have created something that is all my own.
